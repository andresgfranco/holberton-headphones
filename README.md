# Implementing a design from scratch with Figma - Holberton School webstack advanced program - By: Andrés González
In this project, I implemented from scratch, without any library, a web page using all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that we learned previously.

The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

For this project it was not necessary to use JS since the main purpose was to implement a responsive design.
